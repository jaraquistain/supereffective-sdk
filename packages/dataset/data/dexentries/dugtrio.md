Dugtrio, a Ground-type Pok√©mon, is known for its unique triple-headed appearance. In various generations, Pokedex
entries highlight its ability to burrow underground, reaching depths of over 60 miles.

These three heads work in perfect harmony, allowing Dugtrio to dig through even the toughest soil. They are capable of
striking unsuspecting foes from unexpected directions and have a reputation for triggering earthquakes.
